# leetcode-solutions
This repo is collection of my solutions for LeetCode problems implemented in mainly Python and Java. 

This repository is organized into two main folders: Python and Java  

Each folder contains code for various LeetCode challenges and may be accompanied by explanations of the problem-solving approach. 

Feel free to explore, contribute, and suggest improvements!


# My Python & JAVA Solutions for Leetcode

Remember solutions are only solutions to given problems. If you want a full study checklist for code & whiteboard interview, please turn to [jwasham's coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

Also, there are open source implementations for basic data structs and algorithms, such as [Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/trekhleb/algorithms-in-python) and [Algorithms in Java](https://github.com/trekhleb/algorithms-in-java).

I'm currently working on [Analytics-Zoo](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/) - an unified Data Analytics and AI platform. Check it out, if you are interested in big data and deep learning.
